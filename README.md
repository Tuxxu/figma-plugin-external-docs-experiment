# External Docs - Figma Plugin Experiment
<img src="/static/plugin-experiment-docs.gif" width=50% height=50%>
A plugin experiment to show related external documentation for a selected component/instance.

## How it works
The plugin reads the component description and searches for the `@api` key. If there's a match, it uses the component name to serve the corresponding page of the documentation.

I've used Github Primer and the Primer docs as an example as this requires cross-origin requests and not a lot of public styleguides have this enabled :)

## Next steps
I don't have any further plans for this experiment - but perhaps it will be useful for someone else!
